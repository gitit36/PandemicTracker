1. Install PyMySQL: pip install PyMySQL
2. Download MAMP and crate a database with whichever name you choose. 
3. Look at the init.py file, in the configure section, change your data to match your database
4. the render_template functions will lead to files in the template folder. However, if you look at the html files, in the areas with "url_for," you have to reference a function within that route. (Ex: home.html says "url_for("hello")) instead of url_for("/")
5. to run,  
export FLASK_APP=init.py
python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/



 To populate the database, run the file, "run this once".
